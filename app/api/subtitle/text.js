"ROBLOX That's right, you didn't mishear me. The last part of this video is also about ROBLOX. It's the most searched word on Google in the past year. It's also one of the most versatile and easy-to-access gaming platforms in the world. It's no exaggeration to say that ROBLOX is one of the most popular web pages for gamers, especially young gamers, because of its ease of use. But did you know that ROBLOX has been struggling for a while because it's been dead for 3 days, always having to worry about data upgrading and many accusations related to abusing children, becoming a theft tool and more? Let's take a look at the origin, formation and development of ROBLOX. Before we get to the origin of ROBLOX, let's take a look at its father, David Bazooki. Bazooki was born on January 20, 1963. Bazooki was born on January 20, 1963. Bazooki was a fan of ROBLOX and his nickname was Builder Man. This is the name of his character in his game ROBLOX. Bazooki was a businessman, engineer and developer of American-Canadian software. When he was a kid, he was just like other kids who loved to ride bicycles, ride go-karts and read books about imaginary science stories. Bazooki went to Eden Prairie Middle School in Minnesota, USA. He was the captain of the school's cheerleading team. Later, Bazooki studied computer science at Stanford University. During his studies, he worked for a company specializing in automotive software called General Motors. During this time, he worked mainly in the company's lab and focused on designing a software that could control automotive engines. Bazooki graduated in 1985 as a student of General Motors In the late 1980s, when he was still in college, Bazooki and his brother Greg Bazooki founded a technology company called Knowledge Revolution. Here, they cooperated and developed an interactive physics software called Interactive Physics. This is a type of technology that can be applied to education. It allows players to create and simulate physical experiments in 2D. Not only that, Knowledge Revolution continued to design another simulating software called Working Model to simulate human actions and reactions in 2D. In December 1998, Knowledge Revolution was officially bought by MSC Software, a software company based in Newport Beach, California with a value of 20 million USD. After this successful venture, Bazooki was immediately appointed Vice President and General Director After that, he decided to leave to found his own company called Bazooki & Associates, an investment company that specializes in financial support for startups. However, Bazooki only kept his spirit from 2003 to 2004. During this time, he played the role of an investor and provided his hidden capital to Friendster, a young social network service. After leaving Bazooki & Associates, Bazooki and one of his colleagues Eric Castle, who used to serve as Deputy Technical Director in his previous Interactive Physics project, joined hands to work on a project called DynaBlox. This is the first prototype of Roblox. The beta phase of this system was extended for a year. The most basic mechanisms of Roblox are also based on DynaBlox. In 2005, Bazooki and Castle decided to change the name of this project to another, easier to read and remember. With the combination of two words Robots and Blocks, the name Roblox was officially born. In the same year, Roblox Corporation also officially went into operation. It was founded by two main developers, Bazooki and Castle, to manage their games. With the founding of this company, the ambitious project of both developers was finally completed. In the meantime, Bazooki and Castle have been working hard to develop their games.\n\nwho were ready to be tested. Finally, on September 1, 2006, Roblox officially launched on all platforms at that time. This is an online game platform combined with a game design system. It allows users to create their own game or play games created by others. This achievement is thanks to the experience that Bersuki has accumulated from projects in the past. The best sellers are Interactive Physics and Working Model. Since its launch, Roblox has undergone many upgrades and significant changes. In March 2007, Roblox decided to update and change some features to protect its young users. Under the US government's Copper Act, the system will limit the interaction with other players under the age of 13 and prevent them from receiving messages sent to the harmful group. In August of that same year, Roblox officially launched a major update that included a maintenance upgrade and most importantly, the launch of a high-end member service called Builder Club. If you join this member package, you will lose a fixed monthly fee, but in return, users will be given a large number of Roblox, a monthly payment unit, and 10% more rewards when you install Roblox on Roblox. At the same time, when you become a member of Builder Club, you will also be able to open many key features on the free version. This system was later renamed to Roblox Premium. In December 2011, Roblox officially held their first annual event, and named it Hack Week. This is where game developers on Roblox sit together, work and come up with groundbreaking ideas for new games to become the leading team of Roblox Corporation. In 2012, Roblox officially stepped into the IOS business and joined the mobile gamers. However, only 2 years later, in July 2014, the version for Android devices was officially released. On October 11, 2013, Roblox Corporation began a campaign to attract more attention from new game developers. In it, they started by launching a program called Developer Agent. Through this project, the company will allow their game developers to exchange the number of rebirths they earn from playing into real money. By 2015, Roblox continued to update some important features called Smooth Terrain, thereby improving the realism of the terrain in the game and making it look smoother and more beautiful. On November 20, the same year, Roblox officially stepped into Microsoft's Xbox One. However, the players of this brand are not free to choose the games they want due to the huge difference between a PC and a console. Therefore, they can only access at least 15 games due to Roblox Corporation's trustworthy team. This number has then increased over time, but it still can't be compared to the number of games and other brands that can play. To explain this, we know that Roblox games for Xbox One are forced to participate in a rigorous process and follow the standards of the entertainment software community in order to be released on this platform. In April 2016, Roblox officially launched a VR version dedicated to the Oculus Rift virtual reality. At that time, the platform also recorded more than 10 million games created. At the same time, the safe conversation feature, according to the COPPER law, has been replaced by another system that works more effectively. Specifically, for gamers under the age of 13, they will be able to use Roblox's interactive features as usual at a certain level and only see the words listed in the playlist available in Roblox. For normal users, they will also be limited to using the words in the game's blacklist. For example, when you use words that are crude and a bit vulgar, Roblox's system will automatically cover those words. Until June of that same year, for the first time in history, Roblox had to update the system in order to be able to enjoy the Windows 10 machine. Throughout 2017, Roblox Corporation decided to completely reform its game. This was to update the technology for the game's machine, because what they were using to run Roblox at that time was outdated and often had to stop operating due to many unfortunate events. Also this year, Roblox has completely closed its forum and moved its interactive features.\n\nin the system of the official website. By November 2018, Roblox continued the reform to help professionalize their community in this game. Players who use customer accounts without logging into the game system will be deleted and lose all data. Since then, Roblox requires you to have an account to be able to experience most of the game's services. And then by the end of 2019, early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic officially broke out globally. Households have to isolate themselves and lose many means of communication. And so, Roblox is used as one of the popular ways to help children and adolescents communicate as well as interact with each other. In July 2020, Roblox officially announced the development of a system called PortableX, a feature used to create virtual space where we can hold events like weddings, birthdays, or more simply, just meeting friends. This feature is based on new technologies that the company has applied in the 2020 Blossier World event that just took place. With the launch of this system, Roblox Corporation has done a double job by providing a tool to connect people to each other during the COVID-19 pandemic. They were able to attack the Metaverse market that was rising at that time. The pandemic has also contributed to the increase not only in Roblox's revenue, but also in the number of players. According to statistics, in a year, from February 2020 to January 2021, Roblox has seen a record increase from a company estimated at $4 billion to $29.5 billion. Even in October 2021, Roblox was estimated at $41 billion. Roblox was officially licensed and released in China on December 3, 2020. Through that, it marks the first time that Roblox Corporation cooperated with the big man Tencent to enter the private market. However, after that, Roblox officially closed their owners in China because they were planning to create another version dedicated to this market. But an internal document of Roblox was leaked in 2022 revealed the truth that the reason Roblox withdrew from China was because they encountered too many obstacles in the process of following this country's copyright law. Moreover, they were worried that Tencent could create a similar platform and use it as a competitor to Roblox. This would make them lose their exclusive copyright. In September 2022, Roblox Corporation announced that they were planning to add a 13-year-old player to their age group. This system helps to distinguish and limit the violence content in the games that are suitable for 13-year-old players. Moreover, at the same time, Roblox also announced that their main target was people in the age group from 17 to 24 years old. This is the group with the largest number and fastest development according to statistics from this platform. So if anyone in this age group is criticized for playing children's games, don't worry because the main target of Roblox is up to 24 years old. In general, Roblox is one of the platforms that has received a lot of mixed reviews. Most people think that Roblox has the ability to stimulate the creativity of children and will be good for their growth and development. At the same time, the number of players created on this platform is also considered to be diverse and there are quite a lot of different types. Maybe you already know about this sound. This is the sound that is emitted every time your character in Roblox dies. This sound has become an indispensable part of this game platform to the extent that it can become a quite famous meme. But do you know? This sound actually does not originate from Roblox. This sound effect was created by the hands of an electronic music composer Mr. Tommy Tallarico and dedicated to a game called Messiah released in 2000. But this is a low-level game low enough that Roblox thinks they can get this effect but no one knows that they stole it. And of course, this led to a copyright dispute between the two sides. It all ended when Roblox lost and had to pay a sum of money to Tallarico and remove their brand sound from the platform and replace it with another sound.\n\nBut do you know what's more interesting? This is just the lightest case of Roblox I've ever met. As we have mentioned above, Roblox has a story system, and developers are also studying, using many methods to prevent abusive words as well as content with violence in the game. However, there are still a large number of users who can break the law and use those words as usual. To solve this problem, Roblox Corporation has also hired 1,600 employees at the same time, with the only task being to monitor and delete harmful content from their website. In addition, Roblox also provides the ability to modify private keys, so parents can control their children's social network more easily. However, in front of the huge number of Roblox users, this solution does not seem to work very effectively. Not only that, even though the content of abusive words is completely banned on Roblox, there are still a lot of games that can break the law and give themselves many inappropriate images. There is even a virtual love club or night club in this platform. In a survey by Fast Company magazine in 2020, they found that there are still a lot of abusive content in Roblox, and the efforts of developers to eliminate this problem did not go anywhere, because as long as they can solve this problem, another problem will arise. However, their efforts have also begun to be more effective. In recent years, the frequency of abusive content in Roblox has decreased significantly. That's not all. Roblox is a friendly platform for children. Or at least we think so. With a large number of users, most of them are children under the age of 13. Of course, this platform must pay attention to these children, because this is the age that has not yet formed their minds and awareness of the world around them. So do they really care about them or not? In fact... Let's take a look at some serious cases related to Roblox. Our gaming platform is often criticized for creating conditions so that children can easily spend a lot of money through their trading channels. This has led to many embarrassing cases when children spend a lot of money on their parents' trading platforms that they don't even know about. Even Professor Jean Jaffer at Cornell University also accused Roblox of encouraging consumerism in children. Roblox also caused a lot of doubts regarding the abuse of children and carried out many forms of fraud against underage people. Recently, in April 2022, the Truth in Advertising organization filed a complaint against Roblox to the Federal Trade Commission for their fraudulent marketing behavior. There was even an embarrassing incident when a 7-year-old girl was playing Roblox on her iPad. The girl was seduced by a group of teenagers into an 18-plus game and then committed the act of seducing the girl. Fortunately, at that time, the girl's mother was sitting next to her and was able to take the iPad and get out of this game. Or on March 4, 2021, a serious incident happened when a 13-year-old girl was kidnapped and sexually assaulted after a fraudster cheated on Roblox. To be honest, I don't know what to say about these people. Specifically, a 33-year-old girl confessed to being a victim of Roblox and persuaded the girl to leave the house after 2 days of confession to meet in real life. It was criticized. But Roblox is still growing. As of May 2020, each of the most popular games on Roblox had more than 10 million active users per month. As of August this year, at least 20 games have been played more than 1 billion times and more than 5,000 games have reached the number of more than 1 million times. Along with that huge number of players, of course, there will be a huge financial source. The iOS version of Roblox surpassed $1 billion in total revenue in November 2019. This number continued to increase very quickly and reached $2 billion in October 2020, making Roblox the second-highest-earning iOS application of all time. Not only Roblox, but also the game development team on this platform has also made a lot of money. Some games have even made $10 million in revenue in one year. Only in 2020, the amount of money that all game developers on Roblox can recover is estimated to be up to $250 million. And of course, Roblox became the third-highest-earning game in 2020, with a revenue of $2.29 billion due to the impact of the pandemic, only behind PUBG and Honor of Kings by Tencent. That's right.\n\nwith the people involved in the development of Roblox. So what about his father, Bazooki? According to statistics, Bazooki owns about 13% of Roblox Corporation, which is a company that owns Roblox. The share of this company is estimated to be worth about $470 million in 2020. According to Business Insider, Bazooki is the 7th highest-paid CEO in the world in 2021, which is 332.8 million USD. Roblox is a platform created to target children under the age of 13, but it is not really a good environment for children. However, we cannot deny the popularity and success of Roblox. In fact, many games on this platform are of high quality and are warmly welcomed by gamers. So let's wait and see what Roblox will do in the future.
